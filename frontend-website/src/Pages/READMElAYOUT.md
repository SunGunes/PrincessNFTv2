It defines a component called Layout which is exported as the default export. The Layout component has three parts:

The first part imports two components Outlet and Link from the react-router-dom library, which provides routing functionality for the application.

The second part imports two custom components Footer and NavbarComponent from the relative path ../Components/Footer/Footer and ../Components/NavbarComponent/NavbarComponent respectively. These two components are used in the Layout component to render the website's header and footer.

The third part defines the Layout component as a functional component that returns the JSX elements.

The Layout component returns the JSX elements wrapped inside a React fragment <> </>.

Inside the fragment, it first renders the NavbarComponent component. Then, it uses the Outlet component which is a special component provided by the react-router-dom library. It is used to render the child components of the current route. Finally, it renders the Footer component.

Overall, the purpose of the Layout component is to provide a consistent layout structure for the website.
